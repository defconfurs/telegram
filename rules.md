# DEFCON Furs Telegram Chat Rules

Last Updated March 31, 2020. 

We want to continue to encourage our community participation in all topics DEF CON and DEFCON Furs. In the last few weeks, we have seen our chat become a hotbed of negative unrest and anxiety, this is quite a departure from our core rule of being excellent to each other.  By our count, there are more negative posts than those offering a solution.

**Like the rest of you, we aren’t the biggest fan of more rules, but…**

****

**To help us keep our chat on track we are enacting the following code of conduct for all posts in the chat:**

1) if you want to complain, please try to offer a suggestion on how to improve the situation

2) if you want to tell us how everyone else is stupid. Try to keep it friendly, open, and conversational. A good way to start may be to share a stupid thing you’ve done.

3) if a thread consistently has more than 3X more messages than participants, please take it private

If you enjoy our community, we encourage you to stick around and keep sharing.

There are several topics that are creating the bulk of the negative feels.  The following topics are not banned.  We would appreciate your _consideration and sensitivity_ for our larger community when discussing the following**:**

Covid-19 / Coronavirus

political figures / elections

religion

government action / laws

depression

death / suicide / suicide jokes

“Everyone is stupid” points of view

Moderating a large group is hard and we are doing our best to create a consistent response across admins/mods.
