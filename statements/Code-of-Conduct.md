1) Nazis, white supremacists, other bigots, and their sympathizers have no place in our community and will be removed on site.
2) Ad hominems or personal attacks, or arguing in bad faith, will warrant moderation action. We are a diverse and thriving community, please practice tolerance and acceptance
3) Participating in this chat means you agree to follow the rules.
4) All moderator actions may be appealed to any moderator.

We are also enacting the following CoC for our moderators

All moderators are empowered to operate independently. When a member brings you an issue either deal with it as soon as you can. Any issue be delegated to a fellow moderator. If you delegate it, let the requestor know who you delegated it to and why.

1) All first warnings will be PM or verbal
2) All second warnings will be public and use the /warn feature of Grey Wolf Executrix
3) All actions must use the /warn or /ban function in Grey Wolf and will be logged and auditable
4) repeating above, All moderators are empowered to operate independently. Since their actions are auditable, we can handle appeals and inappropriate moderation actions more effectively.

We have changed the way we are using our primary moderation tool.
